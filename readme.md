This implementation defines a function `isPalindrome` that takes a word as an input. It uses two counters, `start` and `end`, to compare characters located at the ends of the word. The loop continues as long as `start` is less than `end`. If any characters don't match, the function returns `false`, indicating that the word is not a palindrome. If all characters match, the function returns `true`, indicating that the word is a palindrome.
